INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Block','General',0,'<p>The Block skill affects the results rolled with the Block dice, as explained in the Blocking rules.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Dauntless','General',1,'<p>A player with this trait is capable of psyching themselves up so that they can take on even the very strongest opponent. The skill only works when the player attempts to block an opponent who is stronger than himself. When the skill is used the coach of the Dauntless player rolls two dice and adds them together. If the total is greater than the opponent\'s Strength value, then the Dauntless player\'s Strength is counted as being equal to his opponent\'s when he makes the block, before any bonuses for skills and defensive or offensive assists are added. If the dice roll is less than or equal to the opponent\'s Strength value, then the Dauntless player must use his normal Strength for the block.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Dirty Player','General',0,'<p>A player with this skill has trained long and hard to learn every dirty trick in the book. If he fouls an opposing player then add +2 to either the Armour or the Injury rolls. Note that this skill can only be used if the player actually makes a foul; it may not be used if he is assisting another player who is making a foul. The Dirty Player skill may be used to modify an Amour or Injury roll for a foul, not both.</p>','<p>The +2 for Dirty Player stacks with the standard +1 for a Foul action, resulting in a base +3.</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Frenzy','General',1,'<p>A player with Frenzy must always follow an opponent up if they push them back. In addition, if a frenzied player pushes back an opponent without knocking them over, then they must follow up the opponent and then throw another block at them, which is worked out using the normal rules. Frenzy is not used with secret weapon attacks or any other kind of attack other than a straightforward normal block on one opponent! Note that these changes mean that a frenzied player can now only throw ONE additional block per team turn, no matter what the result of the second block. Also note that if the second block pushes the opposing player back then the frenzied player must still follow up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the frenzied player is taking a Blitz action and runs out of normal movement, he can stop attacking (ie, he does not have to throw the additional block), although he can Go For It to throw the block if you want him to ? assuming he still has go for it squares left of course.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Kick','General',0,'<p>In order to use this skill the player must be set up on the field when his team kicks off. The player may not be set up in either wide zone or on the line of scrimmage. Assuming all of these conditions are met then the player is allowed to take the kickoff. Because his kick is so accurate, the number of squares that the ball scatters on kick-off is halved, rounding any fractions down (ie, 1 = 0, 2-3 = 1, 4-5 = 2, 6 = 3).</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Leader','General',1,'<p>The player is a natural leader and inspires the rest of the team while he is on the field. Having such a player in the team allows the coach to take a Leader Re-roll counter at the start of the match and at halftime and place it on the Re-roll track along with his Team Re-roll counters. A team may only ever have one Leader Re-roll counter, even it has several players with this skill. The counter is used in exactly the same way as a Team Re-roll counter, but it may only be used if a player with the Leader skill is on the playing field (standing or prone) at the time the counter is used.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Nerves of Steel','General',1,'<p>The player may ignore the -1 dice modifier for enemy tackle\r\nzones when he attempts to pass or catch the ball.</p>','<p>Can this skill be used to catch a bouncing ball or a throw-in?</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Pass Block','General',0,'<p>A player with this skill is allowed to move three squares\r\nwhen the opposing coach announces that one of his\r\nplayers is going to pass the ball. This move is made out\r\nof sequence, after the range has been measured, but\r\nbefore any interception attempts have been made.\r\nHowever, the move may only be made if it allows the\r\nplayer to move into a position to attempt an interception,\r\nor to put the thrower or catcher in his tackle zone. The\r\nopposing coach is not allowed to change his mind about\r\npassing the ball after the player with this skill has made\r\nhis move. The special move is free, and in no way affects\r\nthe player\'s ability to move in the following turn. Apart\r\nfrom this, however, the move is made using all of the\r\nnormal rules, and the player does have to dodge in order\r\nto leave opposing players\' tackle zones.</p>','<p>A \"turnover event\" during a Pass Block move does not disallow other players from making their Pass Block moves. For example, if my first Pass Blocker fails a Dodge roll and falls over, I can continue to take Pass Block moves with other players.</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Pro','General',0,'<p>A player with this skill is a hardened veteran. Such players are called professionals or Pro\'s by other Blood Bowl players because they rarely, if ever, make a mistake. Once per team turn, a Pro is allowed to re-roll any one dice roll he has made. However, before the re-roll may be made, his coach must roll a dice. On a roll of 4, 5 or 6 the re-roll may be made. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3 the original result stands and may not be re-rolled with a skill or team re-roll. A player cannot use this skill to re-roll an Armour or Injury roll.</p>','<p>Pro can be used to re-roll a dice roll made by the player in the opponent\'s turn as well as your own (e.g. Interception).</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Shadowing','General',0,'<p>The player may use this skill when an opposing player moves out of his tackle zone. Each coach rolls a dice and adds their own player\'s movement allowance to the score. If the shadowing player\'s coach manages to equal or beat the other coach\'s score, then he may move his player into the square vacated by the opposing player. He does not have to make any Dodge rolls when he makes this move, and it has no effect on his own movement in his own team turn. If the Shadowing player\'s coach rolls less than the other coach\'s score then his player is left standing. A player may make any number of shadowing moves per turn. If a player has left the tackle zone of several players that have the Shadowing skill, then only one of the opposing players may attempt to shadow him.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Strip Ball','General',0,'<p>A player with this skill forces any opposing player that he\r\npushes back to drop the ball in the square that they are pushed\r\nto, even if the opposing player is not knocked over.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Sure Hands','General',0,'<p>A player with the Sure Hands skill is allowed to re-roll the dice if he fails to pick up the ball. In addition, the Strip Ball skill will not work against a player with this skill.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Tackle','General',0,'<p>Opposing players who are standing in this player\'s tackle zone are not allowed to use their Dodge skill if they attempt to dodge out of the player\'s tackle zone, nor may they use their Dodge skill if the player throws a block at them.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Catch','Agility',0,'<p>A player who has the Catch skill is allowed to re-roll the dice if he fails to catch the ball. It also allows the player to re-roll the dice if he drops a hand-off or fails to make an interception.</p>','<p>Can the Catch skill be used for bouncing balls or throw-ins?</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Diving Catch','Agility',0,'<p>The player may use this skill if the ball was thrown to him and missed. It allows the player to move one square after the ball has scattered. This move is made after the ball has scattered, but before it hits the ground or can be caught. No Dodge roll is required to make this move. If the move takes the player into the square that the ball is in then he is allowed to try and catch it. Although a player using a Diving Catch ends up on the ground for a moment, because this is a controlled fall he will not be injured and he will almost instantly regain his feet. Therefore the player is not knocked over when he uses the skill.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Diving Tackle','Agility',0,'<p>The player may use this skill after an opposing player attempts to Dodge out of his tackle zone. Place the player using this skill prone in the square vacated by the dodging player, but do not make an Armour or Injury roll for them. The opposing player must then subtract -2 from his Dodge roll for leaving the player\'s tackle zone. If a player is attempting to leave the tackle zone of several players that have the Diving Tackle skill, then only one of the opposing players may make a diving tackle.</p>','<p>The decision to use Diving Tackle is made after the a Dodge roll is made, but not after a reroll. If a player chooses to use Diving Tackle and his opponent rerolls the Dodge roll, the player has already used Diving Tackle and the -2 applies to the reroll as well. The player with Diving Tackle has no choice in the matter. Likewise, if the player chose to not use Diving Tackle, they can\'t change their mind and decide to use it for the reroll attempt.</p>\r\n<p>Diving Tackle can be used any time an opponent attempts to Dodge out of a player\'s tackle zone, including out-of-sequence moves such as during a Pass Block move.</p>\r\n');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Dodge','Agility',0,'<p>A player with the Dodge skill is allowed to re-roll the dice if he fails to dodge out of an opposing player\'s tackle zone. However, the player may only re-roll one failed Dodge roll per team turn. In addition, the Dodge skill affects the results rolled on the Block dice, as explained in the Blocking rules in the Blood Bowl book.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Jump Up','Agility',1,'<p>A player with this skill may stand up for free at the start of any action; he does not have to pay three squares of movement. This means that the player can take a Block action even when he is prone, because he can stand up for free at the start of the action.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Leap','Agility',0,'<p>A player with the Leap skill is allowed to jump over an\r\nadjacent square, even if it is occupied by a knocked over or\r\nstanding player from either team. Making a leap costs the\r\nplayer two squares of his normal movement. In order to make the leap, move the player to any empty square adjacent to the square that they are jumping over, and then make an Agility roll for the player. No modifiers apply to this dice roll at all and the player does not have to dodge to leave the square he starts in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the player successfully makes the dice roll then they make a perfect jump and may carry on moving. If the player fails the Agility roll then he falls over in the square that he was leaping to, and the opposing coach may make an Armour roll to see if he was injured. A failed leap counts as a turnover, and the moving team\'s turn ends immediately. A player may only use the Leap skill once per action.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Side Step','Agility',0,'<p>A player with this skill is an expert at stepping neatly out of the way of an attacker. To represent this ability, his coach may choose which square the player is moved to when he is pushed back, rather than the opposing coach. Furthermore, the coach may choose to move the player to any adjacent square, not just the three squares shown on the Push Back diagram. The player may not use this skill if there are no open squares on the field adjacent to this player. Note that the coach may choose which square the player is moved to even if the player is knocked over after the push back.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Sprint','Agility',0,'<p>The player may attempt to move up to three extra squares\r\nrather than the normal two. Their coach must still roll to see if the player falls over in each extra square he enters.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Sure Feet','Agility',0,'<p>The player may re-roll the dice if he falls over when trying to go for it. A player may only use the Sure Feet skill once per action.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Accurate','Passing',0,'<p>The player may add +1 to the dice roll when he passes the ball.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Dump-Off','Passing',0,'<p>This skill allows the player to make a Quick Pass when an\r\nopposing player declares that he will throw a block at him,\r\nallowing the player to get rid of the ball before he is hit. Work out makes his block. The normal throwing rules apply, except that neither team\'s turn ends as a result of the throw, whatever it may be. After the throw is worked out your opponent completes the block, and then carries on with his turn.</p>','<p>This skill must be used before the Block dice are rolled. All skills that affect a Pass action also apply to a Dump-Off (e.g. Pass, Pass Block, etc.). This may result in a Pass Blocker moving during the Dump-Off and then taking his normal action.</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Hail Mary Pass','Passing',0,'<p>The player may throw the ball to any square on the playing field, no matter what the range; the range ruler is not used. On a roll of 1 the player fumbles the throw, and the ball will scatter once from the thrower\'s square. On a roll of 2-6 the player may make the pass. The Hail Mary pass may not be intercepted, but it is never accurate ? the ball automatically misses and scatters three squares. Note that if you are lucky, the ball will scatter back into the target square! Also note that this skill is very useful when combined with the Diving Catch skill. This skill may not be used in a blizzard.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Pass','Passing',0,'<p>A player with the Pass skill is allowed to re-roll the dice if he misses a pass.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Safe Throw','Passing',0,'<p>Roll a dice if a pass made by the player is successfully intercepted. On a roll of 2 or more the interception is cancelled out. On a roll of 1 the interception takes place as normal.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Strong Arm','Passing',1,'<p>Reduce the range by one band (but never lower than \'Quick\')\r\nwhen the player passes the ball. For example, a long pass is\r\ntreated as a Short pass, etc.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Break Tackle','Strength',0,'<p>The player may use his Strength instead of his Agility when\r\nmaking a Dodge roll. For example, a player with Strength 4 and\r\nAgility 2 would count as having an Agility of 4 when making a\r\nDodge roll. This skill may only be used once per turn.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Guard','Strength',0,'<p>A player with this skill may assist an offensive or defensive block even if he is in another player\'s tackle zone.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Mighty Blow','Strength',0,'<p>Add +1 to any Armour or Injury rolls (not both) made by a player with this skill. This skill may not be used by players with a Strength of 2 or less. This may only be used to modify an Armour or Injury roll caused by a block. Mighty Blow may not be used to modify an Armour or Injury roll caused by a foul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This skill may not be used by players with a Strength of 2 or less. The strength score comes from the player?s position as it is written on the team roster, so a Goblin (St 2) can never use this skill, even if he gains St+1, and a Human Blitzer (St 3) can use the skill even if he later loses a point of Strength.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Multiple Block','Strength',0,'<p>The player is allowed to block two opposing players at the same time. The opposing players must be next to the player making the block and next to each other. Their strengths are added together and both suffer the effects of the block equally. Both sides may use assists normally.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Piling On','Strength',0,'<p>The player may use this skill after he has made a block, but only if the victim was knocked over. The player falls on top of the player that he has just knocked down and may add his Strength to the Armour roll for the victim. For obvious reasons, when a player uses this skill he is knocked over as well. However, do not make an Armour roll for the player who is piling on, as his fall is cushioned by the victim. Note that the player who is piling on is knocked over in his own square rather than that of his victim - it is assumed that he rolls back there after flattening his opponent. If the player has pushed back his opponent before knocking him over, then he must follow up the block if he can in order to use this skill. Piling on does not cause a turnover unless the piling on player is carrying the ball.</p>','<p>A player cannot use the Piling On skill if he is knocked over as well.</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Stand Firm','Strength',1,'<p>A player with this skill is never pushed back as the result of a block. He may completely ignore \'Push Back\' results, and \'Knock-down\' results always knock the player over in the square where he started. In addition, the player does not fall over if he fails a Dodge roll. Although the player stays on his feet, he must return to his starting square. His action ends and he may do nothing else that turn. A turnover, however, does not take place.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Big Hand','Physical',1,'<p>A player with one or more big hands will pick up the ball on a D6 roll of 2 or more if they enter a square where the ball is on the ground. No modifiers apply to this dice roll.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Claw','Physical',1,'<p>A player with a claw may add +2 to the dice roll to modify an Armour roll caused by a block. The claw may not be used to\r\nmodify an Armour roll caused by a foul.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Extra Arms','Physical',1,'<p>A player with one or more extra arms may add +1 to all his\r\nCatch rolls. This trait does not work on interception attempts.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Foul Appearance','Physical',1,'<p>The player\'s appearance is so horrible that any opposing player within three squares of him must subtract -1 from the dice when they pass or catch the ball. In addition, any opposing player that wants to block the player must first roll a dice and score 2 or more. If the opposing player rolls a 1 he is too revolted to make the block and it is wasted (though the opposing team does not suffer a turnover).</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Horns','Physical',1,'<p>A player with horns may use them to butt an opponent. This adds +1 to the player\'s Strength when he makes a block. However, the player may only use this ability as part of a Blitz, and only if he has moved at least one square before he makes the block (standing up at the start of your action does not count!). If the player has the Frenzy trait, then the horns bonus applies on the second block if it applied on the first.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Prehensile Tail','Physical',1,'<p>The player has a long, thick tail which he can use to trip up opposing players. To represent this, opposing players must\r\nsubtract -1 from the dice roll if they attempt to dodge out of the player\'s tackle zone.</p>','<p>The -1 modifier to Prehensile Tail stacks with any other modifiers to the Dodge roll (e.g. Diving Tackle).</p>\r\n');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Razor Sharp Claws','Physical',1,'<p>The player may add +2 to any Injury rolls that he makes. This may only be used to modify Injury rolls caused by a block. They may not be used to modify an Injury roll caused by a foul.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Spikes','Physical',1,'<p>Add +1 to the player?s Armour value.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Tentacles','Physical',1,'<p>The player may attempt to use this trait when an opposing\r\nplayer attempts to dodge or leap out of his tackle zone. Each\r\ncoach rolls a D6 and adds their player\'s ST value to the score. If the result for the tentacled player is higher than the result of the moving player, then the moving player is held firm and may not leave the square or attempt to move any further. If a player attempts to leave the tackle zone of several players that have the Tentacles ability, then only one of the opposing players may attempt to grab him with the tentacles.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Thick Skull','Physical',1,'<p>Roll a dice if the player is KO\'d. On a roll of 4 or more the player shakes off the effects of the injury and it is treated as a Stunned result instead. The player may remain on the playing field and is placed face-down. On a roll of 3 or less the player is placed in the KO\'d Players box in the Dugout as normal.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Two Heads','Physical',1,'<p>Add +1 to all Dodge rolls the player makes.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Very Long Legs','Physical',1,'<p>Add +1 to the player\'s Movement. In addition, the player is\r\nallowed to add +1 to the dice roll whenever he attempts to\r\nintercept the ball.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Always Hungry','Racial Characteristic',0,'<p>The player is always ravenously hungry - and what\'s\r\nmore they\'ll eat absolutely anything! Should the player\r\never use the Throw Team-Mate trait, roll a D6 after he\r\npicks up the player to be thrown, but before he throws\r\nthem. On a roll of 1 he attempts to eat the unfortunate\r\nplayer! Roll the D6 again, a second 1 means that he\r\nsuccessfully scoffs the other player down, with obviously\r\nfatal results for the latter. On a roll of 2-6 the player\r\nsquirms free and should be placed prone in a randomly\r\nselected adjacent square - do not roll for injury (if the\r\nsquare is occupied then the original occupant is pushed\r\nback and knocked over).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make an Armour roll for any player that squirms free. The team does not suffer a turnover unless the thrown player had the ball.

INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Bone-Head','Racial Characteristic',0,'<p>The player is not noted for his intelligence.\r\nBecause of this you must roll a D6 after declaring\r\nan action for the player, but before taking the\r\naction. On a roll of 1 they stand around trying to\r\nremember what it is they\'re meant to be doing. The\r\nplayer can\'t do anything for the turn, and the\r\nplayer\'s team loses the declared action for that\r\nturn. (So if a Bone Head player declares a Blitz and\r\nrolls a 1, then the team cannot declare another\r\nBlitz that turn.)

INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Hypnotic Gaze','Racial Characteristic',0,'<p>This player has a powerful telepathic ability which he can use to stun an opponent into immobility. The player may use the hypnotic gaze after declaring his own action, in addition to anything else the action allows him to do, but he must use the gaze before another player on his team declares an action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The player may turn his hypnotic gaze on one opposing player who is in an adjacent square. Roll a dice: if the score is greater than the victim\'s Agility, then the victim is hypnotised and loses their tackle zone for the rest of the team turn. If the score of the dice is less than or equal to the opponent\'s Agility, then the hypnotic gaze has no effect. A roll of 1 always fails and a roll of 6 always succeeds.</p>','');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Really Stupid','Racial Characteristic',0,'<p>This player is without doubt one of the dimmest\r\ncreatures to ever take to a Blood Bowl field (which\r\nconsidering the IQ of most other players is really saying\r\nsomething!). Because of this you must roll a D6 after\r\ndeclaring an action for the player, but before taking the\r\naction.

INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Stunty','Racial Characteristic',0,'<p>The player is so small that they are very difficult to tackle because they can duck underneath opposing players\' outstretched arms and run between their legs. To represent this the player may ignore any enemy tackle zones on the square he is moving to when he makes a Dodge roll (ie, they always end up with a +1 Dodge roll modifier).

To see where he moves,\r\nplace the Throw-in template over his head facing up or\r\ndown the pitch, or facing toward either sideline. Note\r\nthat you use the Throw-in template rather than the\r\nScatter template. This gives you some control over the\r\ndirection the Fanatic moves in, but not a lot!

Roll the dice\r\nagain to see what has happened to him: 1-3 = Cardiac\r\narrest: The Fanatic dies from over exertion; 4-6 =\r\nKnackered: The Fanatic is worn out, but will recover in\r\ntime for the next match. Apothecaries cannot be used\r\nto heal collapsed Fanatics. A collapsed Fanatic being\r\nknocked over counts as a turnover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only player in an opposing team that can attempt to\r\nblock a Fanatic is another Fanatic.

INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Bomb','Secret Weapon',0,'<p>Penalty Roll: 8+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A coach may choose to have a Bombardier throw a bomb\r\ninstead of taking any other action. The Bombardier is not\r\nallowed to move when he throws a bomb, because he needs to stand still in order to light the fuse. Roll a dice to\r\nsee if he gets the fuse alight without mishap. On a roll of\r\n1 the bomb explodes prematurely in the Bombardier\'s\r\nsquare, with the results described below. On a roll of 2 to\r\n6 he gets the fuse to light and may throw the bomb. If a\r\nplayer holding a lit bomb falls over for any reason then\r\nthe bomb will scatter one square and then explode as\r\ndescribed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bomb is thrown using the rules for throwing the\r\nfootball. The bomb may be intercepted or caught, in\r\nwhich case the player catching it must throw it again\r\nimmediately. This is a special bonus action which takes\r\nplace out of the normal sequence of play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the second (and any subsequent) throws, a dice roll\r\nmust be made to see if the bomb goes off in the (new)\r\nthrower\'s square. For any throws after the first the bomb\r\ngoes off in the thrower?s square on a roll of 1, 2 or 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the bomb lands in a square with a player who decides\r\nnot to catch it, or if it lands in an empty square, then it\r\nwill bounce and scatter one square in the same way as\r\na dropped or missed pass. After it has bounced one\r\nsquare the bomb will explode, even if it ends up on a\r\nsquare that is occupied by a player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the bomb finally does explode - either because a\r\ndice roll is failed or because the bomb has hit the ground\r\nand bounced - it knocks over any player in the same\r\nsquare, and knocks over players in adjacent squares on\r\na roll of 4+. Make Armour and Injury rolls for any players\r\nknocked over by the blast as normal.</p>','');

To see if the player\r\ngets the chainsaw running, make an Agility roll for him.\r\nNo modifiers apply to this dice roll. If the roll succeeds\r\nthe player has managed to turn the chainsaw on, and is\r\nallowed to attack with it in any succeeding turn. If the\r\nplayer fails to start up the chainsaw he is not allowed to\r\nattack with it, though he can try to start it up again in a\r\nfuture turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failing to start a chainsaw does NOT count as a\r\nturnover, and does not end the moving team\'s turn. The\r\nchainsaw must be restarted if it is used again after a\r\ntouchdown has been scored or a half ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A player armed with a running chainsaw may never\r\ncatch or carry the ball, and must drop the ball if he has\r\nit. He can move normally, however, and attack with the\r\nchainsaw instead of making a block. A running chainsaw\r\nis a dangerous thing to carry around, and so if a player\r\nholding a chainsaw falls over for any reason, the\r\nopposing coach is allowed to add +3 to his Armour roll to\r\nsee if the player was injured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A player armed with a chainsaw is allowed to use it to\r\nattack other players instead of making a normal block.\r\nWhen the chainsaw is used to make an attack, do not\r\nroll the Block dice. Instead simply make an Armour roll\r\nfor the victim adding +3 to the score. If the roll beats\r\nthe victim\'s Armour value then they are injured - roll\r\non the Injury table. If the roll fails to beat the victim\'s\r\nArmour value then the attack has no effect. A player\r\narmed with a chainsaw may take part in a foul on a\r\nprone player, and adds +3 to the dice roll instead of\r\nthe normal +1. He may not assist another player who\r\nis committing a foul.</p>','<p>A player can use a Chainsaw during a Blitz action.</p>');
INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Blunderbuss','Secret Weapon',0,'<p>Penalty Roll 10+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Chaos Dwarf who is holding the ball and armed with a\r\nblunderbuss may use it to fire the ball down the field.\r\nThe Chaos Dwarf is not allowed to do anything else\r\nwhen he fires the ball, because he needs the time to\r\nstuff the ball into the muzzle of the blunderbuss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The normal rules for passing the ball are not used\r\nwhen it is fired from a blunderbuss. Instead,\r\nnominate a square anywhere on the field, and then\r\nroll a dice to see where the ball comes down. On a\r\nroll of 1-3 it scatters in exactly the same way as a\r\nkick-off (ie, it scatters the number of squares equal\r\nto the roll of a dice in a random direction). On a roll\r\nof 4-6 the ball is bang on target and may be caught\r\nby a player in the target square in the same way as\r\nan accurate pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the blunderbuss has been used it may not be fired\r\nagain until after a touchdown is scored or a half ends.\r\nThis is to allow time for the weapon\'s user to reload it\r\nwith a fresh charge of gunpowder!</p>','');

A Death-Roller is at its most\r\ndeadly when it is used against prone players who cannot\r\nmove out of the way.

INSERT INTO skills VALUES ('Poisoned Dagger','Secret Weapon',0,'<p>Penalty Roll: 10+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A player armed with a poisoned dagger may use it to\r\nattack another player instead of throwing a block at\r\nthem. Make an Armour roll for the victim. If the score is\r\nless than or equal to the victim\'s Armour value then the\r\nattack has no effect. If the score beats the victim\'s\r\nArmour value then they have been stabbed by the\r\ndagger and an Injury roll must be made. Treat a Stunned\r\nresult on the Injury table as a KO\'d result, because of the\r\neffect of the poison. Once the dagger has been used to\r\nsuccessfully stab a victim (ie, they failed their Armour\r\nroll), then the poison is wiped off and the dagger causes\r\ninjuries as normal until after a touchdown is scored or the\r\nhalf ends.</p>','');
